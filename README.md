# Project-5--Classification-Data

Description
- The Classification model is a supervise learning. this model used for prediction for classification value.
- In this case, the model is designed to predict the CATEGORY_ERROR_PassingParam. This feature is well-suited for classification , as it involves true and false value.

Objective
- The dataset have multi-Class, issues,one hot encoding categorical variables.
- Set Features and Target Features
- Choose features CATEGORY_ERROR(CATEGORY_ERROR_PassingParam) because this label is more dominant in dataset.
- Model Classification will be Logistic Regression,K-NN Model, SVM Model,Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Remove features not using anymore
- Build a model Classificatioon to Predict category of the CATEGORY_ERROR(CATEGORY_ERROR_PassingParam) that will be happen
- Train and Test
- Evaluate The Model
- Compare evaluation each model
- Plot Confusion Metrix
- Plot ROC curve and Precision-recall curve
- Plot Feature Important
- Plot Learning curve
- For Learning Purposes
